# StoryDraw ✨🎨

**StoryDraw** is a collaborative storytelling and drawing app where users co-create visual stories. Each "story" is a collection of drawings from different users, combined to form a unique narrative. The app emphasizes creativity, allowing users to express themselves through drawing and build interactive stories with others.
